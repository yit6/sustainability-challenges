# KONSERVA

Tackling the problem of climate change, Konserva aims to empower users to make a positive difference on the environment around us. Users recieve weekly environmental challenges to complete. Users can also challenge their friends by inviting them to a group and competing to see who does the most challenges. Not only can users complete challenges, but they can also learn further about the science behind  the challenge and more actions they can take to protect the environment.
